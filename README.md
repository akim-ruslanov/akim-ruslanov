Hi, I am Akim and currently I am studying Computer Science and Statistics at UBC Vancouver, BC, Canada. I like to create all sorts of software, from web apps to data analytics. Some of the tools I use include Node.js, React, Django, Flask, Tensor Flow, mySQL, etc. If you are interested to see some of the projects I am the most proud of please visit my website at https://akim-ruslanov.netlify.app/ or check out the repo at https://github.com/akim-ruslanov/portfolio_website. If you want to contact me, feel free to shoot a message to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akim-r-945a34141/) or send an email at akim.ruslanov@gmail.com.
